Salami Interface
===

This provides some handy functionality for pulling annotations / audio from the salami dataset.

The dataset and audio files are provided by some excellent third parties. This is just some handy code for using that data from python scripts.

The audio and annotation directories can be configured in the config module here, but the default values should be useful as they are.

The audio can be downloaded from functions in the `SALAMI` submodule.

The annotation data itself resides in the `salami-data-public` submodule.
